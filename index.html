                    <p class="p2">I have never been the type of person to take something I use on a daily basis as a given, I find myself constantly trying to learn about the things I use the most. Something I spend a lot of time on is my computer; I built my computer and even recently built my keyboard as well. After building my computer I realized how intricate the computer system really is and wanted to know <strong>"how?"</strong> So I took up coding as a way of answering that question and it has slowly but surely taken up all of my free time, I am (at the moment of writting this) taking 4 seperate courses on programming. I hope to transistion to a coding career in the near future and I can't wait to start the office Dungeons and Dragons campaign</p>
